                      Gargantuan skyscrapers that shade an endless tangle of
                      streets. A neon glow that sets the stage for a ballet of
                      flesh and steel. Floodlights and megascreens that blast a
                      sky where hulking AVs glide like fish through water. This
                      is Night City’s core, its heart, its dream turned reality.
                      And at the heart of the heart lies Corporate Plaza, a
                      special zone where corporations govern themselves in every
                      regard, free from outside interference.

                      Is considered by many to be the best place to live and
                      have fun in all of Night City. It is home to many wealthy
                      elites, celebrities, corporates, and most influential
                      members of society. This was not always the case however.
                      In 2023, after the nuclear bomb set off in the Arasaka
                      Tower, a portion of Westbrook closest to the City Center
                      sustained significant damage, turning skyscrapers into
                      ghostly, crooked skeletons for the next two decades.

                      Was originally the military city of North Oak, including
                      some parts of the neighboring Westbrook. After the Fourth
                      Corporate War, the region was flooded by refugees who
                      built their own tent camps around the area. As the
                      rebuilding of Night City begun, the whole of the old North
                      Oak was renamed the Watson Development, with plans to
                      build a massive corporate center adjacent to the one in
                      City Center.

                      catering to corporate employees and tourists alike with
                      its golden sandy beaches, luxurious hotels, and unmatched
                      entertainment. By 2045, the resort functioned as intended,
                      becoming home to the Playland By the Sea amusement park,
                      protected by Militech security contractors, and attracting

                      Is one of the oldest districts in Night City. Due to its
                      location, the district avoided any major damage from the
                      4th Corporate War. It turned into a provisional camp for
                      thousands of citizens seeking shelter. By 2077, the
                      settlements were all gone and Santo Domingo had become a
                      testing ground for industrial projects: corporations
                      destroy old factories, only to build new ones in their
                      place.

                      is seen as a district of complete contrast. The north,
                      borders the City Center, and is where you'll find lush
                      parks and modern skyscrapers towering high above. However
                      further south, the district changes drastically, with
                      dangerous and unwelcoming slums dominating the urban
                      landscape. The Valentinos and 6th Street gangs have
                      control over this district, and are constantly fighting.

                    <p>
                      Beyond Night City and its surrounding suburbs, there is a
                      wide-open space of endless dry Californian scrub,
                      punctuated by the occasional abandoned town or dry lake
                      bed. The Badlands is a region that few Night Citizens
                      willingly venture out into, save for the hardy nomads, who
                      crossed the desert in their huge and well-protected
                      caravans. These vast plains outside of Night City make the
                      metropolis look more glamorous in comparison. However,
                      there's still life and golden opportunities out there.

                Weapons in Night City are widely varied and highly customizable.
                Weapons are the wide array of damage-dealing tools available for
                use, from firearms and melee weapons to cyber-implants and
                remote mines, and much more.
              </p>
              <p>
                Ranged Weapons are typically pistols, shotguns or rifles, and
                can fall under the categories of either Tech or Street. Melee
                Weapons provide an opportunity for up-close violence, while
                Ranged Weapons give the option to kill from afar.
              </p>
              <p>
                Many Weapons can accommodate modules which alter their use and
                the way they handle: for example may acquire a Tech Pistol which
                they then modify using modules to become a Power or Smart
                Pistol.
